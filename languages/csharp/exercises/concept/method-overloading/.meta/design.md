# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the Concept of Method Overloading in C#.

## Learning objectives

- Know what method overloading is.
- Know how to define overloaded methods.
- Know the limitations of method overloading.
- Know how to define optional parameters.
- Know how to pass named arguments.

## Out of scope

- Overload resolution.

## Concepts

This Concepts Exercise's Concepts are:

This Concepts Exercise's Concepts are:

- `method-overloading`: know what method overloading is; know how to define overloaded methods; know the limitations of method overloading.
- `optional-parameters`: know how to define optional parameters.
- `named-arguments`: know how to use named arguments.

## Prequisites

This Concept Exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `classes`: know how to define methods on classes.
- `constructors`: know how to define constructors on classes.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the constructor of the `Character` class uses the `protected` modifier.
- Verify that the various fields used (hit points, spell prepared and potion drunk) use the `private` modifier.
